# Building an RNN to Predict the Next Signal
### By Nick Serger

Building an RNN to predict the next signal of "data.npy". The data file “data.npy” contains a matrix, of 100 rows and 500 columns. Each row represents a signal, which contains the superposition of a large number (larger than 20) of sinusoids with randomly generated
amplitudes, frequencies, and phases.

This evaluation was started as the final project for George Mason University's ECE 699: Deep Machine Learning Final Project.
